The intent of this page is to highlight the work of Bahamian entrepreneurs and their businesses. 

Tourism and banking are the Bahamas' most profitable industries and are both led and owned primarily by foreign interests. While many are happy with the status quo and boast about the few Bahamians in leadership positions within larger companies, this page seeks to add visibility to the Bahamians who build something of their own. Despite the hurdles and red tape that the government often places in front of its own citizens that make starting a business all the more difficult, these Bahamians have succeeded and can be role models for other Bahamians around the country. 

If there are particular businesses you think should be on this page, please send us an email!
