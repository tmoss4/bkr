##### Our vision is a politically well-educated Bahamas.
<br/>
Bahamas Knowledge Revolution is part of the [Paper Beats Rock Collection][1] and was conceived and created by its founder, Theo Moss. <br/>
BKR was one of the first projects that I wanted to come out of Paper Beats Rock and it was designed to do three things:

1. To elevate the expectations of the political stage in the Bahamas. 
* I believe that political parties and individuals politicians should be made to stand for something. Their promises, mistakes, and achievements should be recorded and made easily available. Politics should involve ideas and mature debate rather than food, music, and name-calling.
2. To track measurable areas of progress or decline in our country and surface that information publicly.
* We improve what we measure and it is critically important that we have both past and present data available to objectively judge our current status.
3. To educate and inform Bahamians in order to erase the ignorance that leads to poor decision making.

Armed with this information, Bahamians will be protected from groups that tell the public things are good when they are in power and terrible when they are not. This site aims to prevent individuals from misleading others or themselves as to the state of the Bahamas.
Ignorance breeds violence and there is an abundance of both in the Bahamas.

Lastly, as a big fan of ZenPencils, I want to share this [comic][2]. Real knowledge is a way of not fooling ourselves.
