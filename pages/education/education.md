There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that "my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."
<br/>- Isaac Asimov

Anti-intellectualism is hostility towards and mistrust of intellect and intellectual pursuits, usually expressed as the derision of education, philosophy, literature, art, and science, as impractical and contemptible.

Education has never been a true priority in the Bahamas for a plethora of reasons. Examination scores, particularly in core subjects such as English and Mathematics, have been consistently low for over a decade and it is an annual ritual to lament the poor exam results and then do nothing meaningful about them.

Education is a complex issue and its relation to other problems is discussed more on the [Issues][1] page. 

## Brain Drain

Brain drain is a phenomenon where the most intelligent members of an area relocate for better opportunities. This has been a persistent issue for the Bahamas and is a major hurdle for the development of the country. Brain drain is a viscious cycle in many ways as the Bahamians who are most likely to improve things and create jobs leave and so conditions remain poor and so more Bahamians leave, and so on. Effective solutions to break this cycle has been an ongoing subject of debate.
