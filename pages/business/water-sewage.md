WSC has noted that the cost of constructing a comprehensive
sewage treatment system on New Providence would be “prohibitive.” (page 50)

The [Water and Sewage Corporation][1] (WSC)...

A further critical issue is that years of inadequate maintenance have left the system with an extremely high water loss rate – as high as 58% in previous years. Non-revenue water losses are the target of recent investments. These investments are showing dividends and the WSC has reported 'reduced water losses by over one billion gallons within the last two years, a savings of $6.5 million.'

WSC has limited sewer services, with about 15 to 20% coverage on New Providence and almost none on the Family Islands. The facilities are old and usually provide very minimal treatment. Most households depend on septic tanks for the handling of their wastewater.
