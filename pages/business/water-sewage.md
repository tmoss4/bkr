WSC has noted that the cost of constructing a comprehensive
sewage treatment system on New Providence would be “prohibitive.”

<br/> - State of the Nation Report, page 50

The control and administration of the water resources of the Commonwealth rests with the Bahamas Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) within the portfolio of the Minister of Works & Transport, along with the Minister of Public Utilities. The [Water and Sewerage Corporation][1] is a wholly owned corporation entrusted under the Water and Sewerage Corporation Act (1976) with the duty of optimal development of the country's water resources, their allocation and distribution and the control of their quality.

The Water and Sewerage Corporation Act (1976) defines the responsibilities of the Corporation in several sections, these responsibilities and duties include but are not limited to:

<li>To provide water supplies for domestic and other uses, provide adequate drainage and dispose of sewage and other effluent</li>
<li>To extend the water and sewer systems in the country</li>
<li>To ensure and control the optimum development and use of the water resources</li> 
<li>To serve as advisor to the Minister responsible for water and sewerage, draft regulations and register users of the systems</li>

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE CORPORATION

The Minister of Works has ultimate responsibility for the Water & Sewerage Corporation. However, a board of directors, appointed by the Government, heads the Corporation. The Government selects no more than five members, who are called the "appointed members", and a representative from the Ministry of Finance. The Government selects a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman of the Board, from the "appointed members". Members of the Board shall serve no longer than three years. The Board is responsible for making policy decision and is kept abreast of the operations of the Corporation by the General Manager, who is also appointed by Government. The General Manager (GM) is assisted by the Deputy General Manager (DGM), who as the Chief Operations Officer, is responsible for the daily operations of the Corporation and reports directly to the GM. The DGM is assisted by a team of Assistant General Managers (AGMs), who are each responsible for a Division within the Corporation.

ISSUES

Years of inadequate maintenance have left the system with an extremely high water loss rate – as high as 58% in previous years. Non-revenue water losses are the target of recent investments. These investments are showing dividends and the WSC has reported 'reduced water losses by over one billion gallons within the last two years, a savings of $6.5 million.'

WSC has limited sewer services, with about 15 to 20% coverage on New Providence and almost none on the Family Islands. The facilities are old and usually provide very minimal treatment. Most households depend on septic tanks for the handling of their wastewater.
