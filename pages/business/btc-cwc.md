BTC's CEO is [Leon Williams][3], an industry veteran who has been involved with the company for over 20 years.

BTC was previously entirely government owned, however in April 2011, the government privatized BTC by partnering with and transfering shares to CWC (based in London) for $210 million.  

Ownership of BTC was split between the government and CWC. BTC owned 49% economic shares and 49% voting shares while CWC owned 49% economic shares and 51% voting shares (thus controlling interest). The remaining 2% of economic shares were in a national trust. This changed in 2014 when a controlling interest (as a 2% share of the company) was transferred from CWC back to the government.
