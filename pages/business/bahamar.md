Baha Mar is a mega-resort under construction on New Providence and its creation has been steeped in turmoil and controversy for nearly as long as it has been around. The collosal project has been marked by poor management, financial troubles, betrayal, bankruptcy, heavy criticism, and frustration.

There are hundred of articles to choose from on the history of the $3.5 billion project, however, the best source I've found is this phenomenal article which tracks the development debaucle and covers [everything you need to know][1] about the project! The sections below are a summary of the development track from that page.
