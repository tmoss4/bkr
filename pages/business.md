The Bahamas has an open, two-sector, service-based economy with a traditionally stable economic environment. Tourism is the leading sector with a total direct and indirect contribution of 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) and financial services is the second major sector contributing 11-15% GDP. 

As many Bahamians know, ownership in both sectors is concentrated among a few foreign investors. Although the Bahamas is one of the richest Caribbean nations, most of the wealth does not go to Bahamian citizens.

"The recent international financial crisis and subsequent economic slowdown have illuminated the structural weaknesses in the Bahamian economy due to its substantial reliance on a single sector – tourism – and the substantial reliance within this sector on a single country – the United States – for its prosperity. As a result, the economic downturn in the U.S. has caused an even greater slowdown in the Bahamian economy. It could be said that the worsening economic situation of The Bahamas has in turn caused an increase in social disruption, poverty and crime." [State of the Nation Report, page 60][1]
