<h5>*Political positions are from the parties' wikipedia pages.</h5>
<h5>**No constitutional amendments have ever been passed in the Bahamas by referendum. Furthermore, they are generally a <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/brexit-trump-referendums-political-exclusion-214014">poor way of making decisions</a>. It is difficult for many citizens to separate their feelings for the current administration from the vote itself and so referendum results tend to be a better indicator of how the public feels about a particular party rather than the issues themselves.</h5>
