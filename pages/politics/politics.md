I'm worried that students will take their obedient place in society and look to become successful cogs in the wheel - let the wheel spin them around as it wants without taking a look at what they're doing. I'm concerned that students not become passive acceptors of the official doctrine that's handed down to them from the White House, the media, textbooks, teachers and preachers.
<br/>- Howard Zinn

Our first Prime Minister, Sir Lynden Pindling, held the office for 19 years as part of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). He was succeeded by Hubert Ingraham of the Free National Movement (FNM). Since 1992, Hubert Ingraham and Perry Christie of the PLP have alternated holding the office of Prime Minister for the last 25 years. 

The PLP and the FNM have been the two major political parties for most of the country's history although there is little that separates the two. Both political parties are center-right of the world stage and do little to assert how their stances differ. Growing tired of one after 5 years, Bahamians vote for the opposing party to win, and the cycle continues.

Political debates are largely missing from the national discourse and parties rely on rallies and pointing out the opposing parties latest mistakes.

The construction of the system itself prevents citizens from voting for an individual without implicitly supporting their party leader. Primarily, the decision for Prime Minister takes prescendent and citzens vote for individuals because of their political party affliation rather than anything else. It is common to hear individuals say they are voting for a party rather than an individual. Like in many other countries, many individuals and families are staunch supporters of a particular party and vote for the individual from that party regardless of anything else.

More so than many other countries, however, there is a systemic ignorance about how the government operates including what their powers and responsibilities are. Many deals are conducted behind closed doors and parties rely on the public mood rather than their actual accomplishments to remain in power. 

There are few ways to get involved in politics and only disparate sources for Bahamian political information, until now.
