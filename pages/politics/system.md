Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.

## Overview {#overview}

The government of the Bahamas consists of three majors parts:
<li> The Queen (represented by the Governor-General)</li>
<li> An elected House of Assembly (lower house / chamber)</li>
<li> An appointed Senate (upper house / chamber)</li>

### The Queen of the Bahamas

The formal head of the Bahamian government is a woman, Queen Elizabeth II. She appoints a viceregal representative called the Governor-General to carry out her constitutional duties in her absence. 

<h5>Powers and Responsibilities</h5>

In conjunction with the Prime Minister (the leader of the major ruling party), the Governor-General appoints government Ministers ( The role of the Governor-General is not well understood or documented outside of the constitution. 

Term Limits: The Governor-General typically ends their term within five years but have no term limits.

### The House of Assembly

The House of Assembly (HoA) consists of 38 'Members of Parliament' (MPs) who are elected from individual constituencies (neighborhoods). Jump down to the voting section by clicking here to learn more about that process. These 38 MPs are the only elected government positions.

These results implicity decide two other positions:
<p>1. The Prime Minister - the controlling head of the Bahamian government
<br/>2. The Leader of the Opposition</p>

While affliation with a political party is not necessary to run for a MP position, the two named positions require it. 

The office of Prime Minister is held by the leader of the party which wins a majority of House of Assembly positions (also known as seats). Political parties hold leadership conventions where they elect their party leaders.

The Leader of the Opposition is appointed by the Governor General and is typically the leader of the party which wins the second highest seat count. (This is not always the case as we saw in 2016 when Loretta Butler-Turner was appointed as the Leader of the Opposition while Hubert Minnis was still the leader of the FNM).

<h5>Eligibility</h5>

The constitution stipulates two requirements for holding a membership position in the House of Assembly:
<p>1. being a citizen of the Bahamas who is 21 years or older
<br/>2. residing in the Bahamas for at least one year immediately before the date of nomination for election</p>

* You do not need to reside in the constituency in which you are interested in running.

<h5>Powers and Responsibilities</h5>

The HoA performs all major legislative functions.

Term Limits: 5 years

Some MPs are also selected as Ministers of one of 17 areas such as education, finance, and foreign affairs. See "Ministries" section below.

### Senate

The Senate consists of 16 members called Senators. These Senators are not elected, rather, they are appointed by the Governor-General after consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. To decide on the Senator positions, the Governor-General consults:
<li> the Prime Minister alone to appoint 9 of these Senators;</li>
<li>the Leader of the Opposition alone to appoint 4;</li>
<li>both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Oppositions to appoint the remaining 3.</li>

<br/>The Senate has a leadership position called the President of the Senate.

The Senate is meant to operate as a checks-and-balance much like the US system.

<h5>Eligibility</h5>

The constitution stipulates two requirements for being appointed as a Senator:
<br/>1. being a citizen of the Bahamas who is 30 years or older
<br/>2. residing in the Bahamas for at least one year immediately before the date of appointment

<h5>Powers and Responsibilities</h5> 

The Senate can pass bills and make bill amendments which must be approved by the House of Assembly. The Senate may reject a bill that has passed the HoA. However, if the House passes the bill in two successive sessions, after Senate refusal, the HoA may send the bill directly to the Governor-General without the Senate's consent.

Term Limits: 5 years

## Voting {#voting}

The only elected positions in the Bahamian government are the 38 Members of Parliament.

The 38 MPs correspond to 38 individual constituencies and citizens may only vote in their residential constituency.

"...The current legal framework does not grant the electoral management body supervision of campaign finance, nor does it delegate this function to other public entities. In fact, political campaigns are fully funded from private sources. Campaign financing is currently unregulated and political parties are not required to report on the flows or administration of their campaign funds." <a href="http://www.vision2040bahamas.org/media/uploads/State_of_the_Nation_Summary_Report.pdf">State of the Nation Report, page 32</a> This has led to serious allegations of corruption in the past. Campaign financing can decide elections and reveal conflicts of interest.

<h5>Eligibility</h5>

To vote you must:
<p>1. be a citizen of the Bahamas who is 18 years or older
<br/>2. residing in the Bahamas for at least one year immediately before the date of appointment</p>
