There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that "my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."
<br/>- Isaac Asimov

Anti-intellectualism is hostility towards and mistrust of intellect, intellectuals, and intellectual pursuits, usually expressed as the derision of education, philosophy, literature, art, and science, as impractical and contemptible.

Education has never been a true priority in the Bahamas for a plethora of reasons. Grades in English and Mathematics have been constant at C/D and E respectively for more than a decade. It is an annual ritual to lament the poor exam results and then do nothing but the same thing the following year.

Education is a complex issue involving the students, parents, teachers, curriculum, learning environment, grading and evaluation methods, and the broader societal culture and reality.

## Students & Parents

Something something

## Teachers

The Bahamas has taken after the United States in viewing, treating, and paying teachers as low-skill workers. 

## Curriculum

The Bahamas has yet to follow the lead of successful nations in revamping national curricula and teaching for the 21st century. Increasingly, school's are training students for US exams such as the SAT and Advanced Placement exams to varying success. 

## Learning Environment

Something something

## Grading and Evaluation Methods

The national high school exams are the Bahamas Junior Certificate (BJC) and Bahamas General Certificate Secondary Exams (BGCSE) - originally created 19xx. They follow the British GCSEs and focus on superficial mastery. 

## Broader Societal Culture & Reality

Tourism is currently and has historically been the Bahamas' primary industry. Service jobs with little education required. This reality is the thread that connects all the previous factors. Parents with low-skill jobs may want a better life for their children but can't imagine what they would do with a better education besides those professions viewed as reserved for the truly talented like medicine or law. Students have few successful Bahamians to idolize as role models and cannot imagine what more education could help them acheive in the Bahamian economy. Many of the most academically successful students leave the Bahamas for better learning opportunities and implicitly the Bahamas cannot be a place for intelligent people who have more options.
