Right now, there is an increasing skills gap between what the economy needs and what the labour force can offer. This leads to the underemployment of Bahamians with many of the best jobs going to people from outside the country. This creates a climate in which it is easier for crime to get a foothold.

For every complex problem, there is an answer that is simple, easy, and wrong.

The issues our country faces are multifaceted and interconnected. Crime, unemployment, poverty, doing businee, education, social issues - these problems do not exist in vacuums and must be examined together in order to perceive the entire picture of where we stand as a country.

Better education will matter much less if there are no good jobs available and Bahamians are restricted from creating their own. Parents, teachers, and the students themselves can find little motivation to value academic achievement when there is no work to aspire to besides low-skill service work. More good jobs will matter much less if Bahamians don't have the skills necessary to do them. Unemployment would remain high which would lead to poverty and the links between poverty and crime are well researched and documented. Better policing then matters much less when the root causes of crime remain unaddressed. Societal norms praise (often under the guise and aid of religious belief) intolerance, ignorance, and anti-intellectualism common in many poor and poorly educated populations. 

Unfortunately, there is no fundamental issue that is the base of them all which we could magically fix and have all our problems solved. Managing a country is difficult and the leader who does so must be able to view things holistically.
