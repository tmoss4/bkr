&lt;p&gt;enforcement issues with the Planning and Subdivision Act, 2010 essentially render the act inactive (page 35)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bahamas ranks among the most water-scarce of all Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the world. In addition to threats to freshwater resources, there are issues presented by the country’s close relationship to the ocean. Inadequate management and monitoring pose significant threats to the coastal and marine environment, including increased vulnerability to storm  surge and sea level rise due both to direct impacts (dredging, removal of mangroves and landfilling) and indirect impacts (pesticides and sewage discharge and runoff). The Bahamas is overwhelmingly a marine country, both in its location and biological diversity, which presents important challenges. Fisheries policy and management are ill equipped and enforcement of regulations is weak. The effects of fisheries activities are not well understood, with research and science in this area a major gap. The risk of oil spills from existing energy plants is another significant challenge to the coastal and marine environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses due to damage from extreme events affect the country’s financial stability. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 was a relatively low intensity hurricane that still had a total economic cost of $702.8 million, approximately 9% of the GDP. More recently, Hurricane Joaquin destroyed large segments of the southern islands of The Bahamas. The direct cost of storm related damage has been estimated at $100 million with the total economic impact still being assessed. A National Disaster Preparedness and Response Act was developed in 2006 and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) was established to improve the nation’s capacity to manage disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental Risks Due to Climate Change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bahamas is considered one of the top ten most vulnerable nations in the world to the impacts of climate change. This is due in part to the combination of its small land area and the low elevation of islands, along with development, economic activity and population concentrated near the coast. How The Bahamas adapts to climate change will in part define its future. A sea level rise of 1 meter would eliminate 80% of the landmass of the country. The specific impacts of climate change that will have significant effects include:
increases in atmospheric temperature; intense rainfall events but less annual rainfall;
increased sea surface temperatures; 
increased ocean acidity; 
sea level rise; 
increasedtropical storm activity; 
and rising water tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be direct human impacts (population and health) and indirect human impacts (biodiversity, water, infrastructure, and industry). Although these broad impacts have been researched, there has been limited analysis of the vulnerabilities of specific Islands, settlements or industries to the impacts of climate change. There is an urgent need for the nation to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the government has acknowledged that climate change is a serious issue, there has been little systematic and comprehensive adaptation. The preliminary steps that have been taken include:
Developing the National Policy for Adaptation to Climate Change in 2005;
Becoming a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC); 
and Establishing a National Climate Change Committee in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of climate change, however, has received more attention recently. In January 2014, the government hosted the first ever National Environmental Conclave and the urgency of this matter was raised by The Bahamian delegation at the United Nations Climate Change Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bahamas faces a number of other specific environmental issues in the areas of
biodiversity, waste management, land development, air quality and challenges in the
institutional and legal framework for environmental management. Management of solid waste is an ongoing concern with respect to the condition of landfills, the burning of waste at landfills and dumpsites, and the need to improve recycling practices. Experts have pointed to the negative effects on respiratory health from the frequent fires at landfills in New Providence.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vision2040bahamas.org/media/uploads/State_of_the_Nation_Summary_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;State of the Nation Report, page 55-57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
