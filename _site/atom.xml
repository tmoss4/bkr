  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /.medium-4.columns --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;medium-8 medium-pull-4 columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The government of the Bahamas consists of three majors parts:
* The Queen (represented by the Governor-General)
* An elected House of Assembly (lower house / chamber)
* An appointed Senate (upper house / chamber)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-queen-of-the-bahamas&quot;&gt;The Queen of the Bahamas&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The formal head of the Bahamian government a woman, Queen Elizabeth II. She appoints a viceregal representative called the Governor-General to carry out her constitutional duties in her absence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: The Governor-General typically ends their term within five years but have no term limits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: In conjunction with the Prime Minister (the leader of the major ruling party), the Governor-General appoints government Ministers ( The role of the Governor-General is not well understood or documented outside of the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-house-of-assembly&quot;&gt;The House of Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The House of Assembly (HoA) consists of 38 ‘Members of Parliament’ (MPs) who are elected from individual constituencies (neighborhoods). Jump down to the voting section by clicking here to learn more about that process. These 38 MPs are the only elected government positions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These results implicity decide two other positions:
1. The Prime Minister - the controlling head of the Bahamian government
2. The Leader of the Opposition&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While affliation with a political party is not necessary to run for a MP position, the two named positions require it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The office of Prime Minister is held by the leader of the party which wins a majority of House of Assembly positions (also known as seats).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party which wins the second highest seat count.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: The HoA performs all major legislative functions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some MPs are also selected as Ministers of one of 19 areas such as education, finance, and foreign affairs. Jump down to that section by clicking here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;Senate&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate consists of 16 members called Senators. These Senators are not elected, rather, they are appointed by the Governor-General after consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. To decide on the Senator positions the Governor-General consults:
* the Prime Minister alone to appoint 9 of these Senators;
* the Leader of the Opposition alone to appoint 4;
* both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Oppositions to appoint the remaining 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate has a leadership position called the President of the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate is meant to operate as a checks-and-balance much like the US system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: The Senate can pass bills and make bill amendments which must be approved by the House of Assembly. The Senate may reject a bill that has passed the HoA. However, if the House passes the bill in two successive sessions, after Senate refusal, the HoA may send the bill directly to the Governor-General without the Senate’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;ministries&quot;&gt;Ministries&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are 19 distinct areas of government interest that are led by an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Agriculture, Marine Resources and Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Education, Science and Technology&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Environment and Housing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Finance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Financial Services&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Foreign Affairs and Immigration&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grand Bahama&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Housing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Labour and National Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;National Security&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Office of the Attorney General &amp;amp; Ministry of Legal Affairs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Public Service&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Social Services and Community Development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tourism&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Transport and Aviation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Works and Urban Development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Youth, Sports and Culture&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;voting&quot;&gt;Voting&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The only elected positions in the Bahamian government are the 38 Members of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The 38 MPs correspond to 38 individual constituencies (neighborhoods) in which an MP must have resided for a certain period of time in order to be eligible to run in that area. Similarly, citizens may only vote on the set of individuals running in the constituency in which they have resided for a certain period of time. This leads to MPs restricting their campaigning efforts to the constituency in which they are running.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An individual does not need to be affliated with a political party in order to run. However, because the Prime Minister is not elected and rather is the party leader of the winner of most MP seats, many citizens see voting for an independent candidate as an inability to directly affect who becomes Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The citzens’ inability to directly vote for the Prime Minister is one of the primary reasons for the extreme degree of ‘party politics’ seen in the Bahamas. Unlike in the US where political parties are split on social and economical issues, political parties in the Bahamas are primarily differentiated by individuals and the party leader. Subsequently, many citizens vote for individuals running with a particular party because they approve of the party leader rather than the individual themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Who Can Run:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Who Can Vote:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;constituencies&quot;&gt;Constituencies&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are 38 constituencies, 24 on Nassau and 14 on the family islands.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/bkr/politics/statistics/">&lt;p&gt;You can find some great graphs at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefirstsay.org/&quot;&gt;The First Say&lt;/a&gt;! and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vision2040bahamas.org/media/uploads/State_of_the_Nation_Summary_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;State of the Nation Report&lt;/a&gt;! I’ve recreated some here and added a few more of interest along with some of the most interesting facts about the Bahamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For crime statistics: check out the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) annual reports for the Bahamas like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=19192&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/bkrissues/crime&quot;&gt;crime page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For education statistics: check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vision2040bahamas.org/media/uploads/State_of_the_Nation_Summary_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;State of the Nation Report&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/bkreducation/exam-results&quot;&gt;exam-results page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;womens-issues&quot;&gt;Women’s Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first woman elected to Parliament was Janet Bostwick in 1982 for the Free National Movement (FNM).
* Women were only given substantive posts in Cabinet after the FNM won the 1992 general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as a people voted to deny women equal rights in the passage of citizenship to their children in two constitutional referenda - 2002 and 2016. It is not a crime in The Bahamas for a husband who is still with his wife to rape her.&lt;/p&gt;

This page includes basic information about their views on various issues. Idealogical differences between the parties has previously been removed from the political discourse, however, this page categorizes their notable actions and quotes from party leaders in order to build a party profile.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2015, after same-sex marriage was legalized in the US nationwide, Branville adjusted his position to being personally against supporting individuals&#39; equal rights, but added that his party did not yet have a formal position. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tribune242.com/news/2015/jun/26/bran-bahamas-must-address-gay-marriage-issue/&quot;&gt;[Ref]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;*Political Position: Center-left&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Notable: The PLP is largely responsible for the various issues relating to the overspending and underemployment related to &lt;a href=&quot;htttp://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Articles/27571/Tracking-Baha-Mars-development-trek&quot;&gt;Baha Mar&lt;/a&gt; and the overspending related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bahamaslocal.com/newsitem/131596/Junkanoo_carnival_and_how_we_define_success.html&quot;&gt;Carnival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Notable: The PLP supported the passing of the constitutional ammendements that would prevent discrimination based on sex and held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamian_constitutional_referendum,_2016&quot;&gt;referndum in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, however, all amendments were rejected.** This was a new position for the PLP as they openly campaigned against &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamian_referendum,_2002&quot;&gt;a similar referendum&lt;/a&gt; held in 2002 before the election which also included amendments seeking to end gender discrimination.

&lt;h5&gt;*Political positions are from the parties&#39; wikipedia pages.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;**No constitutional amendments have ever been passed in the Bahamas by referendum. Furthermore, they are generally a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/brexit-trump-referendums-political-exclusion-214014&quot;&gt;poor way of making decisions&lt;/a&gt;. It is difficult for many citizens to separate their feelings for the current administration from the vote itself and so referendum results tend to be a better indicator of how the public feels about a particular party rather than the issues themselves.&lt;/h5&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Where any such decision as is referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article is taken by any  Commission or  authority, the  Commission or  authority shall  cause  to  be delivered to the officer concerned, or to his personal representatives, a written notice of that decision stating the time, not being less than twenty-eight days from the date on which the notice is delivered, within which he, or his personal representatives, may apply to the Commission or authority for the case to be referred to the Public Service Board of Appeal.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;When the Board has completed its consideration of the case, then-
a.  if  the decision that is the subject of reference to the Board is such a decision as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a) of this Article, the Board shall advise the appropriate Service Commission or authority whether the decision should be affirmed, reversed or modified and the Commissioner authority shall act in accordance with that advice; and
b.  if the decision that is the subject of the reference to the Board is such a decision as is referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(b) of (c) of this Article, the Board  shall  not  have  power  to  advise  the  Commission  or  authority concerned to affirm, reverse or modify the decision but-
i.	where the officer has been removed from office the Board may direct that there shall be granted all or any part of the award that, under any law, might have been granted in respect of his service in a public office if he had retired voluntarily at the date of his removal and may direct that any law with respect to awards shall in any other respect that the Board may specify have effect as if he had so retired, and
ii.	where some other disciplinary action has been taken in relation to the office the Board may direct that, on the grant of any award under any law in respect of the officer’s service in a public office, that award shall be increased by such amount or shall be calculated in such manner as the Board may specify in order to offset all or any part of the reduction in the amount of that award that, in the opinion of the Board, would or might otherwise be a consequence of the provisions of any other law.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the appeal relates to a case in which the officer exercises his right of appeal to the Board under Article 115(1) of this Constitution, the Board shall first consider his appeal under that Article and only if it decides to affirm the decision or to make some other decision the consequence of which would be to affect the officer’s award, shall the Board proceed to consider the officer’s appeal under this Article.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For the purposes of this Article-

&lt;p&gt;The Bahamas is a dangerous places for LGBTQ+ individuals and popular opinion is mixed at best. A combination of religious fearmongering, ignorance, and xenaphobia have often led to violent levels of homophobia. Especially on Nassau, ‘gay’ is often used as a slur and adults who display anything but stereotypical normative behaviors are imagined to be homosexual or mentally ill. This is, of course, complete nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred Mitchell, Minister of Foreign Affairs (2012-2017), has been outspoken on the need for comprehensive LGBTQ rights and we salute him for it. We stand with him and all intelligent individuals who recognize that “a violation of human rights anywhere is the business of free people everywhere.” (Ronald Reagan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;medium-8 medium-pull-4 columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The government of the Bahamas consists of three majors parts:
* The Queen (represented by the Governor-General)
* An elected House of Assembly (lower house / chamber)
* An appointed Senate (upper house / chamber)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-queen-of-the-bahamas&quot;&gt;The Queen of the Bahamas&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The formal head of the Bahamian government a woman, Queen Elizabeth II. She appoints a viceregal representative called the Governor-General to carry out her constitutional duties in her absence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: The Governor-General typically ends their term within five years but have no term limits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: In conjunction with the Prime Minister (the leader of the major ruling party), the Governor-General appoints government Ministers ( The role of the Governor-General is not well understood or documented outside of the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-house-of-assembly&quot;&gt;The House of Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The House of Assembly (HoA) consists of 38 ‘Members of Parliament’ (MPs) who are elected from individual constituencies (neighborhoods). Jump down to the voting section by clicking here to learn more about that process. These 38 MPs are the only elected government positions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These results implicity decide two other positions:
1. The Prime Minister - the controlling head of the Bahamian government
2. The Leader of the Opposition&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While affliation with a political party is not necessary to run for a MP position, the two named positions require it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The office of Prime Minister is held by the leader of the party which wins a majority of House of Assembly positions (also known as seats).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party which wins the second highest seat count.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: The HoA performs all major legislative functions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some MPs are also selected as Ministers of one of 19 areas such as education, finance, and foreign affairs. Jump down to that section by clicking here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;Senate&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate consists of 16 members called Senators. These Senators are not elected, rather, they are appointed by the Governor-General after consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. To decide on the Senator positions the Governor-General consults:
* the Prime Minister alone to appoint 9 of these Senators;
* the Leader of the Opposition alone to appoint 4;
* both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Oppositions to appoint the remaining 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate has a leadership position called the President of the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate is meant to operate as a checks-and-balance much like the US system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: The Senate can pass bills and make bill amendments which must be approved by the House of Assembly. The Senate may reject a bill that has passed the HoA. However, if the House passes the bill in two successive sessions, after Senate refusal, the HoA may send the bill directly to the Governor-General without the Senate’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;ministries&quot;&gt;Ministries&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are 19 distinct areas of government interest that are led by an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Agriculture, Marine Resources and Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Education, Science and Technology&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Environment and Housing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Finance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Financial Services&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Foreign Affairs and Immigration&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grand Bahama&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Housing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Labour and National Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;National Security&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Office of the Attorney General &amp;amp; Ministry of Legal Affairs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Public Service&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Social Services and Community Development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tourism&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Transport and Aviation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Works and Urban Development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Youth, Sports and Culture&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;voting&quot;&gt;Voting&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The only elected positions in the Bahamian government are the 38 Members of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The 38 MPs correspond to 38 individual constituencies (neighborhoods) in which an MP must have resided for a certain period of time in order to be eligible to run in that area. Similarly, citizens may only vote on the set of individuals running in the constituency in which they have resided for a certain period of time. This leads to MPs restricting their campaigning efforts to the constituency in which they are running.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An individual does not need to be affliated with a political party in order to run. However, because the Prime Minister is not elected and rather is the party leader of the winner of most MP seats, many citizens see voting for an independent candidate as an inability to directly affect who becomes Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The citzens’ inability to directly vote for the Prime Minister is one of the primary reasons for the extreme degree of ‘party politics’ seen in the Bahamas. Unlike in the US where political parties are split on social and economical issues, political parties in the Bahamas are primarily differentiated by individuals and the party leader. Subsequently, many citizens vote for individuals running with a particular party because they approve of the party leader rather than the individual themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Who Can Run:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Who Can Vote:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;constituencies&quot;&gt;Constituencies&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are 38 constituencies, 24 on Nassau and 14 on the family islands.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;thead&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /.medium-4.columns --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;medium-8 medium-pull-4 columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The government of the Bahamas consists of three majors parts:
* The Queen (represented by the Governor-General)
* An elected House of Assembly (lower house / chamber)
* An appointed Senate (upper house / chamber)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-queen-of-the-bahamas&quot;&gt;The Queen of the Bahamas&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The formal head of the Bahamian government a woman, Queen Elizabeth II. She appoints a viceregal representative called the Governor-General to carry out her constitutional duties in her absence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: The Governor-General typically ends their term within five years but have no term limits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: In conjunction with the Prime Minister (the leader of the major ruling party), the Governor-General appoints government Ministers ( The role of the Governor-General is not well understood or documented outside of the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-house-of-assembly&quot;&gt;The House of Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The House of Assembly (HoA) consists of 38 ‘Members of Parliament’ (MPs) who are elected from individual constituencies (neighborhoods). Jump down to the voting section by clicking here to learn more about that process. These 38 MPs are the only elected government positions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These results implicity decide two other positions:
1. The Prime Minister - the controlling head of the Bahamian government
2. The Leader of the Opposition&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While affliation with a political party is not necessary to run for a MP position, the two named positions require it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The office of Prime Minister is held by the leader of the party which wins a majority of House of Assembly positions (also known as seats).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party which wins the second highest seat count.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: The HoA performs all major legislative functions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some MPs are also selected as Ministers of one of 19 areas such as education, finance, and foreign affairs. Jump down to that section by clicking here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;Senate&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate consists of 16 members called Senators. These Senators are not elected, rather, they are appointed by the Governor-General after consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. To decide on the Senator positions the Governor-General consults:
* the Prime Minister alone to appoint 9 of these Senators;
* the Leader of the Opposition alone to appoint 4;
* both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Oppositions to appoint the remaining 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate has a leadership position called the President of the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Senate is meant to operate as a checks-and-balance much like the US system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities: The Senate can pass bills and make bill amendments which must be approved by the House of Assembly. The Senate may reject a bill that has passed the HoA. However, if the House passes the bill in two successive sessions, after Senate refusal, the HoA may send the bill directly to the Governor-General without the Senate’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Term Limits: 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Powers and Responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;ministries&quot;&gt;Ministries&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are 19 distinct areas of government interest that are led by an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Agriculture, Marine Resources and Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Education, Science and Technology&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Environment and Housing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Finance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Financial Services&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Foreign Affairs and Immigration&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grand Bahama&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Housing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Labour and National Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;National Security&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Office of the Attorney General &amp;amp; Ministry of Legal Affairs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Public Service&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Social Services and Community Development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tourism&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Transport and Aviation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Works and Urban Development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Youth, Sports and Culture&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;voting&quot;&gt;Voting&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The only elected positions in the Bahamian government are the 38 Members of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The 38 MPs correspond to 38 individual constituencies (neighborhoods) in which an MP must have resided for a certain period of time in order to be eligible to run in that area. Similarly, citizens may only vote on the set of individuals running in the constituency in which they have resided for a certain period of time. This leads to MPs restricting their campaigning efforts to the constituency in which they are running.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An individual does not need to be affliated with a political party in order to run. However, because the Prime Minister is not elected and rather is the party leader of the winner of most MP seats, many citizens see voting for an independent candidate as an inability to directly affect who becomes Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The citzens’ inability to directly vote for the Prime Minister is one of the primary reasons for the extreme degree of ‘party politics’ seen in the Bahamas. Unlike in the US where political parties are split on social and economical issues, political parties in the Bahamas are primarily differentiated by individuals and the party leader. Subsequently, many citizens vote for individuals running with a particular party because they approve of the party leader rather than the individual themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Who Can Run:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Who Can Vote:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot;&gt;Up to table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;constituencies&quot;&gt;Constituencies&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are 38 constituencies, 24 on Nassau and 14 on the family islands.&lt;/p&gt;
