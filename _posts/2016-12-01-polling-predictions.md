teaser: "Substantial polling data is generally unavailable in the Bahamas, however, the sources we do have point towards a potentially historic election year. 2016 saw the surprising and unprecedented election of Donald Trump and I think the Bahamas is also in for some surprises in the next months."

[Unfinished]
Since the Free National Movement (FNM) won its first election in 1992 with 32/49 seats, neither the FNM nor the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) has ever won re-election as the controlling party. We have flipped back and forth between the two for over two decades but in 2017, that may change. 

The *current* FNM party leader, Hubert Minnis, has faced heavy criticism from his own party members who are attempting to have him removed as their leader. Loretta Butler Turner, Member of Parliament for Long Island, is the forerunner for the leadership position - this comes after a [failed attempt][2] from her to gain leadership of the FNM back in May.

Many view the move as damaging to the FNM's chances to win election but if we have learned anything from the chaos Donald Trump invoked within the republican party - which now controls the US House and Senate with republican Donald Trump at the head - it's that people can overlook a whole mess of things. What's important one week is not important the next and with 5 months remaining until voting takes place, anything could happen. 

A woman as the leader of a major political party would be historic (A lack of term limits made anyone besides Hubert Ingraham or Perry Christie historic really). A woman as Prime Minister would be historic. Despite the Bahamas' [checkered past][3] with woman's rights issues, this could be the new reality in 2017.

Still standing between the PLP-FNM feud is the Democratic National Alliance (DNA). The party entered the arena in 2011 and, while Branville McCartney and his party did not win any seats in the 2012 election, they have been growing their ranks and remaining outspoken against both competiting parties.

Like the United States, the Bahamas employs a [first-past-the-post][4] voting system - a winner-takes-all scenario. This system encourages tactical voting as a vote for anyone other than the runner up are effectively votes for the winner. This is true because by voting for any other candidate, the voter has taken potential votes away from the second place candidate who could have won if they had received those votes. In this way, voters are incentivized to vote only for candiates they believe are likely to win - lest they waste their vote. [Duverger's Law][5] suggests that first-past-the-post systems generally tend towards two-party systems. The DNA will have a difficult time gaining a meaningful foothold in government.

I would love to see a live and recorded debate between the three major party leaders where they discuss the issues. I think it's an important first step to making politicians stand for something and explain their plans beyond generic talking points like 'reduce crime' and 'fix immigration'. It would also be a better platform for argument and discussion than constant attack pieces in the news.

I suspect crime to remain high and national exam scores to remain low. The elections are likely to overshadow these issues entirely, although there have been no successful remedies in the past regardless.
