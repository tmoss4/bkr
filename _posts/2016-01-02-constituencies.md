[Unfinished]
New Providence is a small island of 21x7 miles, much smaller than most US states. Each US state has two senators and one congress-person in government for approximately every 710,000 individuals. 

Are there really substantial unique challenges faced by certain constituencies that separate them from others? Collectively, problems seem to affect the island as a whole rather than simply parts of it. Individual representatives for states makes sense intiuitively as Maine faces much different problems than a state like California. For family islands as well, I think it's incredibly important that there are representatives from other islands. For little Nassau however? I don't see the reason. 

On this point, I agree with the DNA's plan to [limit the number of Members of Parliament to 21][1] or even lower. Branville has also discussed abolishing the senate but my opinion is nearly meaningless here as I'm not exactly sure what the Senate is supposed to do.

I would much prefer to see a system where we voted directly for the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the individual area (education, heatlh, etc.).

I'd like to conduct a survery where I asked students of various grade levels if they were aware of what constituency they live in and what constituency their school is in. I certainly didn't know mine until at least 10th grade. Perhaps I didn't pay enough attention to those sort of things but I went to a school in another constituency and the normal New Providence issues of preparing for hurricanes, crime, lack of electricity, and bad traffic were felt by all. 

I simply do not see strong reasoning behind the current system. It serves as yet another barrier to allowing Bahamian people to put who they want into power. We all live on the same island, the same confined space that is growing denser each year, and yet we have no direct say as to who our Prime Minister is, who our Minister of Works is, who our Minister of Tourism is - the very leadership positions capable of affecting our lives and directing the course of the country the most. I encourage everyone to vote regardless...but what limited power we have.

"The art of the compromise
Hold your nose and close your eyes
We want our leaders to save the day
But we don't get a say in what they trade away
We dream of a brand new start
But we dream in the dark for the most part
Dark as a tomb where it happens"
