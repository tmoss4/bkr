The Bahamas Electrical Corporation (BEC) is...

BEC operates 29 generating plants in 25 island locations as of 2016. [Ref][1]

"The cost of electricity is an important economic issue. Power rates in The Bahamas are among the highest in the Latin American/Caribbean region. Virtually every economic study has suggested that the cost of electricity is a burden on the population and an impediment to improving economic performance and the private sector. One particular challenge is that the country uses petroleum-based fuel to produce most of its electricity to the point where petroleum imports equated to 11% of The Bahamasâ€™ gross domestic product in 2011. Further, there are several pressing issues within the Bahamas Electric Corporation (BEC). Given the archipelagic nature of the country, BEC has a low customer to staff ratio at 93 customers per employee as opposed to 175 in Grenada, 224 in Barbados and 415 in Jamaica. Additionally, the system losses at BEC are about 15%, the highest in the region." [State of the Nation Report, page 46][1]

"Maintenance of generators has been problematic and service is unreliable, such that many more businesses in The Bahamas have emergency generators than their counterparts in the Caribbean. Although the government has embarked on a programme to reform the power sector, there are few energy conservation measures in place. Nonetheless, the recent appointment of a private sector firm to help overhaul BEC provides some basis for optimism." [State of the Nation Report, page 48][1]
