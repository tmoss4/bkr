You can find some great graphs at [The First Say][1]! and in the [State of the Nation Report][2]! I've recreated some here and added a few more of interest along with some of the most interesting facts about the Bahamas.

For crime statistics: check out the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) annual reports for the Bahamas like [this one][3] and the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}issues/crime">crime page</a>.

For education statistics: check out the [State of the Nation Report][2] and the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}education/exam-results">exam-results page</a>.
### Women's Issues

The first woman elected to Parliament was Janet Bostwick in 1982 for the Free National Movement (FNM).
* Women were only given substantive posts in Cabinet after the FNM won the 1992 general election. 

We as a people voted to deny women equal rights in the passage of citizenship to their children in two constitutional referenda - 2002 and 2016. It is not a crime in The Bahamas for a husband who is still with his wife to rape her.
