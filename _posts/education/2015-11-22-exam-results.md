Despite many claims, our national results show little progress regardless of which political party is in power. The reasons behind this are discussed in the main <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/education">Education</a> section.

The problem, of course, extends prior to 2004. Ralph Massey authored an interesting paper on [Academic Failure & The Skills Gap][2] in 2006. He notes that, "since this testing system was started in 1993 the results have always been summarized with a single grade, a D+, D, or D-." 

Averages have unfortunately hidden the depth of the problem in this case. As many Bahamians know historically, private schools like St. Augustine's and Queen's College have typically done much better in national exams than their public school counterparts. The graph below is reproduced from his report and Ralph notes that, "in reality the Bahamas has had a Public School learning problem for several decades and, by talking about the average score for all schools and all subjects, the severity of the problem was not visible to parents and voters." The results were reported this way intentionally, of course, in order to avoid public embarrasment and fool ourselves as far as possible.

The State of the Nation Report notes that "in previous years, only half of graduating high school students actually achieve a diploma in any given year. The rest are awarded a 'certificate of attendance,' meaning they went to class, but did not achieve the standard required for graduation." [State of the Nation Report, page 17][3] The same report quantifies the low results across GLAT, BJC, and BGCSE exams with ~50% of students scoring below a C in all three sets of tests. The graphs in this section are particularly noteworthy.

Things at the Bahamas Technical and Vocational Institute (BTVI) are not significantly better. "Only one-quarter of the students graduate on time and many take up to five years to complete their programmes." [State of the Nation Report, page 22][3]
