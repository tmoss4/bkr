### LGBTQ+ Rights

The Bahamas is a dangerous places for LGBTQ+ individuals and popular opinion is mixed at best. A combination of religious fearmongering, ignorance, and xenaphobia have often led to violent levels of homophobia. Especially on Nassau, 'gay' is often used as a slur and adults who display anything but stereotypical normative behaviors are imagined to be homosexual or mentally ill. This is, of course, complete nonsense.

Fred Mitchell, Minister of Foreign Affairs (2012-2017), has been outspoken on the need for comprehensive LGBTQ rights and we salute him for it. We stand with him and all intelligent individuals who recognize that "a violation of human rights anywhere is the business of free people everywhere." (Ronald Reagan)
